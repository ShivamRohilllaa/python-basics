# Lambda function is used to define a function in single line and it's also called a one line or anonymous function....


# def minus(x, y):
#     return x - y
#
#
# inp = int(input("Enter the 1st no\n"))
# inp1 = int(input("Enter the 2nd no\n"))
# sum = inp - inp1
# print(sum)

# define lambda function
# g is key value and that's very important
g = lambda x: x*x+x
inp = int(input("Enter the number\n"))
print(g(inp))
