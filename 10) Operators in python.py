# 1) Arithmetic Operator
'''print("5+6 is", 5 + 6)
print("5-6 is", 5 - 6)
print("5*6 is", 5 * 6)
print("5/6 is", 5 / 6)
print("5//6 is", 5 // 6)  # This is Floor Division it gives round off number
print("5**3 is", 5 ** 3)  # This is Exponential it means 5 raise to power 3
print("30%7 is", 30 % 7)  # This is Modular Operator it gives the final remainder of the division

# 2) Assignment Operator

x = 5
print(x)
x += 7  Add 7 in 5
# x += 7  Add 7 in 5
# x -= 7  Add 7 in 5
# x %= 7  Add 7 in 5
print(x)
'''
# 2) Comparison Operator
# a) Equals to ==
i = 5
if i == 19:
    print("True")
else:
    print("false")
# b) Not Equals to !=
# c) Greater than >
# c) Greater than and equals to >=
# d) Less than <

# 3) Logical Operator
# And / OR
# -> And Operator
"""a) If both a and b are true then it will be true 
b) If one of value is false then it is false"""

# -> OR Operator
# b) If one of value is True then it is true

# 4) Identity Operator
"""-> is
-> is not """
print (5 is not 5)  # false
print(5 is 5)  # true

# 5) Membership Operator
"""-> in
-> in not """
# Take list example

# 6) Bitwise Operator
# They work with binary numbers
""" 0 = 00
1 = 01
2 = 10
3 = 11 """
